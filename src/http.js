 * `node src/http.js`. Everywhere else in the organization the cluster and the port live in
 * `src/index.js`; here they live here, and `src/index.js` reaches this file by dynamic
 * import when `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` is set. The fork belongs on this path, not on the
 * stdio one. One extra hop, forced by a file that must not move. The task record under
 * `.agents/memory/tasks/` has the reasoning.
 *
 * The application itself is in `src/app.js`, which builds and returns an express app and
 * does not listen. Every route but `GET /healthz` needs the bearer token in `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`,
 * and this process will not start without one. This file owns the port, the interface, the workers, the startup lines,
