 * `src/http.js` owns the port. A file that both builds the app and binds a port cannot
 * be reasoned about, or tested, without binding one.
 *
 * The surface is deliberately narrow: `POST /mcp` and `GET /healthz`, a JSON-RPC 405 for
 * any other method on `/mcp`, a JSON-RPC 404 for everything else, and one answer for a
 * body the transport cannot read. Nothing here is a second source of truth about the tool
 * list — `createServer()` is the same factory `src/index.js` uses on stdio, and it
 * returns a fresh `McpServer` per call, so each request gets its own. Sharing one across
 * requests would be a real bug: `McpServer` holds per-connection state.
