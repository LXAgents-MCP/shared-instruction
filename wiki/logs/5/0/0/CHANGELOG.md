# 5.0.0

**Released:** 2026-10-09

The HTTP transport now requires a bearer token. Every route except `GET /healthz` refuses a
request that does not carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>` matching `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and the
server refuses to start over HTTP without a token of at least 32 characters. The stdio transport
is unchanged and needs no token. **The tool surface and `content/` are unchanged**: the same
tools return the same text. This is a major release because a client of a deployed HTTP instance
that sends no token now gets a `401`, and the new version will not boot without the variable.

**Consumers must:**

1. **Set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` wherever the HTTP transport runs, before deploying this version.**
   At least 32 characters; `openssl rand -hex 32` makes one. The service on Render tracks
   `master` and redeploys on merge, so the variable has to exist there first: the new version
   exits `1` at startup without it, and the deploy fails. Deploying first and setting it after
   is the wrong order.
2. **Send the token from every client of an HTTP instance**, as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
   In a `.mcp.json` that is `"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}" }`, with
   the variable set in the client's environment; with Claude Code it is
   `claude mcp add --transport http … --header "Authorization: Bearer …"`. Without the header
   every request except `GET /healthz` is a `401` and the connector reports no tools. A client
   that can only authenticate through OAuth cannot use a static token.
3. **Put TLS in front of the HTTP transport.** A bearer token over plain `http` can be read on
   the path, and this server does not terminate TLS.
4. **If you run the image over HTTP, pass the token:**
   `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -e MCP_AUTH_TOKEN lxagents-shared-instruction:5.0.0 node src/http.js`.
   The stdio form of the image needs nothing new.
5. **Restart any session that was open**, so the client reloads the connector. A server that
   reports healthy is not a server whose tools are published.

**If you use stdio — a spawned `node src/index.js`, `npx`, or `docker run -i` — you need to do
nothing.** It never reads the variable, and a value set in the environment does not affect it.

## Added

- **`src/auth.js`** — `tokenProblem`, `configuredToken` and `requireBearerToken`. The token is
  read when the app is built, not when the module loads, and surrounding whitespace is dropped
  because a value read out of a file often ends in a newline.
- **`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`**, the sixth environment variable the server reads and the first that is a
  secret.
- **A startup line** saying a bearer token is required on every route except `GET /healthz`. It
  never carries the value.
- **Sixteen tests**, taking the suite from 54 to 70, and every existing HTTP test now runs with a
  token. They cover missing, wrong, malformed and correct credentials; that no route is revealed
  to an unauthenticated caller; that the check runs before the body is parsed; the exact
  `/healthz` exemption; that the token never reaches the output; the refusal to start through both
  entry points, with one worker and with several; and that stdio ignores even an unusable value.
  Four controls were each broken on purpose, and the matching test failed every time.
- **`.agents/memory/decisions/http-bearer-token.md`**, recording why the token is required, why
  the transport and not the bind address decides, and why there is no opt-out.

## Changed

- **HTTP refuses to start without a usable token.** One line on stderr naming the variable and
  the length it found, then exit code `1`. The check runs in the primary before any worker is
  forked, so a missing token is one line and not a respawn loop; `createApp` throws as well, so
  the check cannot be skipped by calling the app directly. There is no flag that turns it off.
- **The token check sits after the `Host` allow-list and before the body parser and every
  route.** An unauthenticated caller cannot make the server read and parse a body, and cannot tell
  a `404` from a `405`. The one exemption is `GET /healthz`, exactly; `/healthz/x`, `POST` and
  `HEAD` are refused.
- Documentation that said this server has no authentication now says what is true: the security
  model, its agent-facing counterpart, the environment, Docker, setup, connect and local-install
  pages, the surface and architecture pages, the README, the Dockerfile comments, the repository
  map and the repository state. Image tags in the examples are `5.0.0`; several had been left at
  `3.1.0`.

## Security

- **The comparison is constant-time**, over SHA-256 digests, so neither the token's length nor how
  much of a guess was right shows in how long the answer takes.
- **The token is header-only.** There is no query-string form, because a URL is logged.
- **The token is never logged, echoed in an error, or put in a response**, and a test asserts it.
- **A bind on loopback does not waive the token.** A reverse proxy on the same host would turn
  that into an open door, and the server cannot reliably tell "local" from its bind address.

## Known limits

- **One shared token.** There is no per-client identity and no revoking one client alone; rotate
  by changing the variable and restarting. The server is stateless, so nothing is dropped.
- **No TLS and no rate limiting in this process.** Both belong to whatever fronts it.
- **The token gates the service, not the text.** The set is on npm and in every checkout, so a
  token on this server does not make any of it confidential.

## Not changed, and noted

Three instruction files still describe the old behaviour and were not edited, because the
discovery protocol reserves edits to instruction files for the owner: the HTTP row of the
"Register it" table in `AGENTS.md`; `.agents/rules/repository.md`, which says "five variables"
and lists the HTTP run command without a token; and the diagnostics table in
`content/skills/engineering/mcp-server.md`, which has no row for a `401`. The last is published,
so correcting it would be a release of its own. They are reported in the pull request.

The Docker image was not built, and nothing was deployed or run against the Render service.
